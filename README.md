# Perry phobos src (latest)
reason i posted this : steal my discord more! 
+ credits for kambing for giving me the src. 
+ also credits for rte for being cool
how to build?
+ open cmd and type cd (path to the folder)
+ then type gradlew.bat setupdecompworkspace
+ and gradlew build
+ the jar should be in build/libs folder
I am aware that perry phobos code is lisenced but because the code isnt made by perry he has no legal right to dmca.
i will fight all dmcas not coming from phobos developers.
